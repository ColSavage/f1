User Guide
Go to: https://mybinder.org/
Click on the dropdown and choose “Git Repository”
Paste: https://github.com/tark-hunt/f1 into the text field next to the dropdown. 
Click the orange button “Launch”
This may take some time. Binder may need to download/analyze the git repository. 
If it fails to launch, see “Other ways to Run”
Open the file: “Capstone.ipynb”
Double clicking will do the trick
Next to “Code” in the toolbar, there will be a button with the description: “Render with Voila” when you hover over it. 
Click on it
A dashboard will then appear, this will be where we can predict finishing positions for each driver depending on the weather and circuit. 
To make a prediction:
Move the sliders to the desired number
Select the circuit and the driver from the dropdowns
And there you have it, the predicted finishing position for that driver!
To see the force plot of the prediction, click “Generate Force Plot”
Note: If a change is made using the weather sliders, the button will need to be clicked again.
To see a scatter plot with all predicted finishing positions for every driver on the selected circuit and weather, click “Generate Scatter Plot”.
You will then be able to hover over each dot on the graph and see each prediction.
Note: If a change is made using the weather sliders, the button will need to be clicked again. 
To see how the model was trained (Accuracy and Feature Importance), click on “Show Test Results”

Other Ways to Run
